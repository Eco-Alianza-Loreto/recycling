      <p>Besides <a href='/' title='Report Your Building'>reporting your building</a>, there are many ways to promote and participate in recycling in your 5+-unit building:</p>
      
      <h3>Call your alderman</h3>

      <p>Email or call your alderman and tell them you want the city to enforce the existing recycling laws. The city provides a <a href='https://chicago.legistar.com/People.aspx' target='_blank'>sortable list of aldermen</a> and their wards. If you don't know which ward you live in, you can input your address and search for your ward.</p>

      <h3>Start your own program</h3>

      <h3>Drop it off.</h3>

      <p>Take your recycling to <a href='http://www.chicagorecycling.org/dropoff.htm'>one of the city's drop-off centers.</a></p>
