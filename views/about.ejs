      <h2>What Group Is This?</h2>
      <p>WIMR (Where is My Recycling?) is a working group that is dedicated to launching a web app to allow multi-unit renters, defined as renters in buildings with 5 or more units, to report that they do not have recycling in their building.</p>
       
      <h2>Why Do People Need That?</h2>
      <p>In 1994, the city of Chicago passed the <a target='_blank' href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WiQrL8nlmBOdywuFgqFrPDokTRhIdFifeo-oCuLIcxc/edit?usp=sharing'>Chicago High Density Residential and Commercial Source Reduction and Recycling Ordinance</a>, commonly known as the Burke-Hansen ordinance, that stated that multi-unit/high-density residents must have adequate access to refuse and recycling disposal. With the completion rollout of the city of Chicago&#039;s Blue Cart program in early 2014, people who live in single-family homes and apartment buildings with 4 or fewer units now do have access to recycling services. Yet, there is still no equivalent service for multi-unit (5+ unit) buildings.</p>
       
      <p>In order to provide recycling services to tenants, landlords in multiunit buildings must contract with a private recycling hauler, and it costs extra money on top of the solid waste disposal fees they already pay. Since the multi-unit recycling ordinance is not enforced, most multiunit landlords opt not to provide recycling services to their tenants. And since the city does not enforce the Burke-Hansen law, there is no channel for multi-unit dwellers to report a lack of recycling services in their building. Thus, it is very hard to determine how much recycling <em>isn&#039;t</em> happening.</p>
       
      <h2>What Will You Do With the Data?</h2>
      <p>The data will help us to visualize reports of recycling noncompliance and provide a hub for residents of multi-unit buildings and other Chicago residents to have a collective voice in favor of more comprehensive recycling services. Once there are a significant number of reports our group can begin to use these reports to show elected officials a rough estimate of how many multi-unit buildings are not providing recycling services. Our group plans to use the visualizations as a tool for advocacy and to push for the strengthening and enforcement of the Burke-Hansen Ordinance.</p>
       
      <h2>How Can I Help?</h2>
       
      <p>You can report your building if it does not have recycling.</p>
