     <p>We&#039;ve received much more response to our little app than we anticipated, and we now need to upgrade some of the services that we use to run the site. <strong>At the moment we are unable to take new reports</strong>, but we anticipate being back up this evening.</p>
     <p>Thanks for your patience,<br>

  <p>However, the City of Chicago does not enforce this law&mdash;and this leads many landlords NOT to provide recycling services to tenants.</p>

  <p>Add your report to our registry to show that your building does not recycle.</p>

  <p>Your report shows that many buildings are NOT offering recycling and that Chicagoans support stronger recycling laws.</p>
